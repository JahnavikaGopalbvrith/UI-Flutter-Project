- Delete tasks from the list.
- User-friendly interface with a clean and simple design.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have the following installed on your machine:

- **Flutter SDK**: [Flutter Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- A code editor such as **VSCode**, **Android Studio**, or **IntelliJ IDEA**.
- **Dart SDK** (Flutter comes bundled with Dart).

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:

   Open your terminal and clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flutter_todo_app.git
   cd flutter_todo_app
   ```

   Replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username if you're uploading to your own repository.

2. **Install dependencies**:

   Run the following command to install all required dependencies:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the app**:

   Ensure your emulator is running or a physical device is connected, then execute:

## App Description

The Todo Application is designed to help users manage their tasks. It includes the following functionalities:

- **Add Task**: Users can enter a new task in the input field and click the "Add" button to add it to the list.
- **View Tasks**: Tasks are displayed in a scrollable list. Each task is shown as a card.
- **Delete Task**: Each task has a delete button that removes the task from the list when pressed.

The app is built with a simple and easy-to-understand design, making it ideal for anyone learning Flutter or mobile development.

## Code Structure

- **`main.dart`**: The entry point of the app, where the `MyApp` widget is initialized. It contains the app theme and sets the home screen widget to `HomeScreen`.
  
- **`HomeScreen`**: This is the main screen of the app, which includes:
  - A list of tasks that can be added and removed.
  - A text input field and button at the bottom of the screen for adding new tasks.

### Functions in `HomeScreen`:

- `addString(content)`: This function updates the input field whenever the user types a new task.
- `addList()`: Adds the entered task to the task list when the user presses the "Add" button.
- `deleteItem(index)`: Deletes a task from the list when the delete button on a task is pressed.

## App Screenshots

### Home Screen Layout:
- **AppBar**: Displays the title "Todo Application."
- **Task List**: Shows all tasks added by the user. Each task appears inside a `Card` widget with a delete button.
- **Text Input and Add Button**: At the bottom, users can input new tasks and click the "Add" button to add them.

## Technology Used

- **Flutter**: An open-source UI software development kit created by Google for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
- **Dart**: The programming language used to build the Flutter app.

## Running on an Emulator or Physical Device

1. **Emulator**: Open Android Studio or VSCode, and launch an emulator. If you're using Android Studio, use the AVD Manager to create and run a virtual device.

2. **Physical Device**: Connect your device via USB and enable Developer Mode and USB debugging on the device.

3. **Run the App**: After the emulator or device is ready, run the following command:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

The app will be built and deployed on the emulator or device.
